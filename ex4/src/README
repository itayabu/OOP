MathTerm- root class (abstract class) defining terms for use in Latex.
	class hold private fields and protected methods for use of the subclasses.
BinariMathTerm- another abstract class, hold two terms
BracketsMathTerm- represents a math term between brackets.
FractionMathTerm- represents a special case of binary math term- fraction.
SimpleBinariOpMathTerm-represents a simple operation between two other terms.
SumMathTerm-This class represents a mathematical sum.
SimpleMathTerm-This class represents a math term which is either a single
	letter variable (x,y,a,b,etc..), or a number.

============
except for abstracting the MathTerm class (see Q&A), I had no design questions.

=  Questions and answers: =
=============================

Q: Say you want to add a new term: an integral term. Describe in few words 
how you would implement it. Which class will it derive from? You can propose
modifications to the class hierarchy.

A: one way will be to inherit the SumMathTerm, and override the "toLatex" 
method so instead of \sum it will print \int.
another way is to build another abstract class- MultiMathTerm that inherit
MathTerm and let SumMathTerm and Integral inherit MultiMathTerm. this way,
in the future if someone would like to multiply or sqare many terms he can
inherit straight from this class.

Q:If there was any implementation difficulty, or challenge.
Please mention and discuss it.

A: The choise between abstract class and interface was not easy.
on one hand, a class that extends abstract class cannot extend other classes
(witch is a drawback), on the other hand, I had some methods I wanted to 
implement at the root class so there will be no need to repeat code 
and get confused.
