 * DESCRIPTION:
 * 			This spaceship attempts to run away from the fight. It will
 *			constantly accelerate,and turn away from the ship that is closest. The
 *			runner has the spying ability and will attempt spying on each round. It
 *			will try to get the nearest ship cannon angle from himself. if that angle
 *			is smaller than 0.2 radians (in any direction) and the distance from the
 *			nearest ship is smaller than 0.2 units, the runner will try to teleport.
