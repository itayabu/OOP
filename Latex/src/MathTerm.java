/**
 * This class represents the base class for all other MathTerms classes you will
 * implement in the exercise. It defines the interface (the public part of the
 * classes) for all other math terms which will extend it. 
 * Most importantly, it defines the method "toLatex" that should be overridden
 * in each of the extending classes. This class is not meant to be instantiated
 * at any point, the only classes that will be instantiated are classes that 
 * extend it. Thus, the "toLatex" method should be left unimplemented 
 * (return ""). It will be implemented, however, in any of this class' 
 * subclasses. The rest of the interface (setExponentTerm, setters and getters,
 * etc.) or any additions you may want to add to this class 
 * (as long as they are hidden do not modify its interface), can and should be 
 * implemented in this class. Later on this course, we will find a more elegant 
 * way to "enforce" subclasses to implement a method rather than leaving 
 * unimplemented methods (abstract, interface). note: The interface allows to 
 * "annotate" the term with bar (upper line), negation or with other MathTerm 
 * as exponent. When more than one of these annotations are set, please evaluate 
 * the latex representation in the following order: exponent, 
 * bar and then negation.
